Issues on data from Excel.
Row:
1. Mobile Number will not be able to parse to Int64 as it has an E inside
2. The date contains letters also so it won't be able to parse it.
3. This row is fine
4.Different format of data saved inside the excel which will lead to entering wrong info inside the form.

Optional issues that can be added:
1. There are certain UiActivities which have omitted certain part of selectors. We can enable those to make the workflow crash.
2. The birthday selection in the form is a bit weird, I made a workaround with UiAutomation on it, it's not the best but it works. I can't use the Select Item activity as its closing the Date picker window inside the form.
